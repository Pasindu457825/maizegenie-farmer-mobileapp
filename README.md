# 🌽 MaizeGenie

MaizeGenie is an AI-powered, bilingual (Sinhala/English) farmer advisory platform designed to support Sri Lankan maize farmers.  
It integrates **price forecasting, cultivation timing, yield prediction, fertilizer advisory, and pest/disease identification** into one farmer-friendly mobile/web application.  
The system is offline-capable and uses **explainable AI (SHAP/LIME)** to ensure transparency and trust.

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 **Corn Price Forecasting & Cultivation Timing**  
  Short-term price predictions (4–8 weeks) using ARIMA, Prophet, LSTM, and GRU, with traffic-light signals (Sell Now / Stable / Wait).  

- 🌱 **Yield Prediction & Fertilizer Advisory**  
  Role-based outputs (Farmer & Agri Officer) with localized soil baselines and CIC fertilizer protocols.  
  Safe Urea/MOP dose recommendations with Sinhala/English TTS and calendar reminders.  

- 🐛 **Pest Identification**  
  Offline AI-based detection of maize pests (e.g., Fall Armyworm) using YOLO models with AR life cycle visualization.  

- 🍂 **Disease Detection**  
  Lightweight CNN models (EfficientNet/ResNet/MobileNet) deployed via TensorFlow Lite for offline disease recognition with safe control steps.  

- 🔍 **Explainable AI**  
  SHAP and LIME visualizations for factor influence, with simplified reason codes for farmers.  

- 📱 **Farmer-Friendly Interface**  
  Bilingual UI, simple icons, voice guidance, traffic-light signals, and offline dashboards for rural usability.
